# ExpoCameraApp

This app uses the React Native framework to take photos two different ways and store them to the photo gallery, which can then seen through the open gallery button.

Camera methods: 
(1) Standard image mode -> take picture and stores it 
(2) Countinuos Timer Mode -> takes 1 picture every 5 seconds and stores images as they are taken.
